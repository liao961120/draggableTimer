# Interval Training Timer

A draggable [interval timer](https://timer.yongfu.name/) written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

This project is inspired by [intervaltimer.com](https://www.intervaltimer.com/create/) and [HTML drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)


Special thanks to [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY)'s YouTube video on building sortable drag & drop elements with vanilla JavaScript.
