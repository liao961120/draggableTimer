# Interval Training Timer

A draggable interval timer written in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 
This project is inspired by [intervaltimer.com](https://www.intervaltimer.com/create/) and [HTML drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).
Special thanks to WebDevSimplified's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY) on building sortable drag & drop elements.
